# Environment

Finetrainers has only been widely tested with the following environment (output obtained by running `diffusers-cli env`):

```shell
- ðŸ¤— Diffusers version: 0.33.0.dev0
- Platform: Linux-5.4.0-166-generic-x86_64-with-glibc2.31
- Running on Google Colab?: No
- Python version: 3.10.14
- PyTorch version (GPU?): 2.5.1+cu124 (True)
- Flax version (CPU?/GPU?/TPU?): 0.8.5 (cpu)
- Jax version: 0.4.31
- JaxLib version: 0.4.31

- Accelerator: NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB, 81920 MiB
NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB, 81920 MiB

NVIDIA DGX Display, 4096 MiB
NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB, 81920 MiB
```

Other versions of dependencies may or may not work as expected. We would like to make finetrainers work on a wider range of environments, but due to the complexity of testing at the early stages of development, we are unable to do so. The long term goals include compatibility with most pytorch versions on CUDA, MPS, ROCm and XLA devices.
